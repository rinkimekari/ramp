# Rust Assistant Manager for Pacman
- An easy, streamlined solution for keeping track of your packages
- Sort your packages into groups of long term, temporary, testing, or dependencies of packages in those groups
- This is a wrapper for pacman, so everything is built-in and automatic

# Plans
- will have a pacman/yay wrapper that interacts with the user
- will have a systemd service that will the wrapper will interact with and execute actions automatically such as removing temporary packages, etc.

# TODO: split repo into wrapper and service crates
